1-10-2016: Starting a repository to store files related to sculptural infinity mirror with LED matrix.

Almost ready to laser cut the materials for the next project: infinity mirror. Here are the shapes. The first image is the frame of the mirror, to be made of wood slices. The wood will probaby be layers of bonded MDF or similar. The two main lines in the image represent the outline of the wood frame, which will be approximately 1" wide with 5mm holes for m4 bolts. The holes will be laser cut as per the image.

I might cover the outside of the wood with copper veneer or something that adds some modicum of protection, along with a few strategically placed ambient effect LEDs.

The dimensions are approximately 30"x15". Depth is yet to be determined -- the layers add up to 1.25"-1.5" but there will be components/wires behind the back panel.

The inside of the frame will have an APA102 Dotstar 144/m LED strip. (~$25/free shipping on aliexpress)

The inside of the infinity mirror ('back') will be made of mirrored acrylic with 25 holes for an LED strand (WS2801 Neopixel).

The outside of the infinity mirror ('front') will be a clear acrylic panel, to which I will need to apply a two-way coating on the inside to create the infinity effect.

The LEDs will be controlled by a Teensy 3.2 -- will need to add a voltage level booster from 3.3v up to 5v.

I haven't ordered the parts yet because I need to make sure everything is right, since they all fit together and I want to minimize redos/cost.
